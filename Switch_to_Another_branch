Steps to switch between different branches on Github
If another_branch already exists locally and you are not on this branch,
then git checkout another_branch switches to the branch.
If another_branch does not exist but origin/another_branch does,
then git checkout another_branch is equivalent to git checkout -b another_branch origin/another_branch; 
git branch -u origin/another_branch.
That's to create another_branch from origin/another_branch and set origin/another_branch as the upstream of another_branch

example-> git checkout -b functionalities master
where functionalities is the new branch or another branch where we have to shift from the main branch master
